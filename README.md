> Action to keep channel content in-sync with Markdown based templates

## Stability

This action is tested on every push with a [Test Workflow](https://github.com/luludotdev/discord-welcome-action/actions/workflows/test.yml) to ensure things function as expected.
However it has not been extensively battle-tested with many different inputs and configurations so please report any issues you may find.

## Prerequisites

- A Discord Bot with `Manage Webhooks` and `Manage Messages` permissions in the target server(s)
- One or more Markdown template documents using the extended syntax (see below)

## Usage

### Action Inputs

| Name            | Type   | Required | Default     | Description                                       |
| --------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `discord-token` | String | `true`   | n/a         | Discord Bot Login Token                           |
| `content`       | String | `true`   | `./content` | Path to a directory containing template documents |

### Markdown Syntax

Template documents can make use of any Markdown syntax that Discord directly supports, as templates are sent almost verbatim to the target channels. You can also use `---` (horizontal rules) to break up the document into multiple messages, otherwise messages will be split automatically.

If you want to insert a blank line between messages, you can use the `::break` special syntax in a dedicated block. The [test data](./test-content/welcome.md) has an example of how to use this syntax.

Images will also be embedded correctly, however **images must be in a message of their own to be parsed correctly.**

Finally, bulleted lists will be transformed to use the Unicode bullet character.

_You can see an example of the syntax [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luludotdev/discord-welcome-action/master/test-content/welcome.md)._

#### Frontmatter

All Markdown templates must have YAML frontmatter to denote the channel target and allow you to pass additional per-template configuration.

| Name          | Type   | Required | Default     | Description                              |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `channel`     | String | `true`   | n/a         | Snowflake ID of the target channel       |
| `senderName`  | String | `false`  | Server Name | Name of the user sending the message(s)  |
| `senderImage` | String | `false`  | Server Icon | Icon for the user sending the message(s) |

### Example Workflow
